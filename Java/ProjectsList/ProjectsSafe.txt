-maximum # on board in non attacking positions

-higher dimensions

-different board sizes (bigger)

-different board sizes (not square)

-with some squares missing (just black tiles, missing the corners, the center square, etc)

-impossible chess board positions.

Graph stuff

-prime labelings (connect coprime numbers)

-maximal prime labelings (connect all coprime numbers and does that graph contain certain graphs like friendship graphs. How many? Ramsay theory?)

-composite labelings (connect numbers that share a factor)

-factor labelings (connect numbers to all their factors)

-stable relationship graphs (infinite series)
